PIP Issues for the barcode software:
Local download and load of opencv, numpy and imutils (pip install from downloads directory)
	python -m pip install opencv_python-4.1.1+contrib-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl	
	python -m pip install numpy-1.16.5+vanilla-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
	IMUTILS - imutils-0.5.3.tar.gz





This won't run as a BAT file but gives the instructions you need within the CMD file

When the PC is booted you need to create a venv environment

>> The following appears necessary each time you enter CMD

venv\Scripts\activate - (required after system reboot)
python -m venv venv
   * this now errors with a security problem
   * instead, cd /venv/Scripts and repeat 
   * need to get to the bottom of it
   
cd PycharmProjects/CM2020

set MAIL_SERVER=smtp.googlemail.com
set MAIL_PORT=587
set MAIL_USE_TLS=1
set MAIL_USERNAME=clubmgr2020@gmail.com
set MAIL_PASSWORD=ClubMgr2020!



(Flaskenv now contains this, no longer required) set FLASK_APP=microblog.py

flask run


Notes:

As part of the dev we did some PIP installs. It appears these don't need to be repeated for every sessions

pip install flask
pip install python-dotenv
pip install flask-wtf
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-migrate
pip install flask-login
pip install flask-mail
pip install pyjwt
pip install flask-bootstrap
pip install flask-moment
pip install flask-babel
pip install guess_language-spirit
pip install requests
pip install wtforms-html5
pip install wtforms_components
pip install SQLAlchemy-ImageAttach

For adding the database functionality, "flask db init"





****MOdule 6 - adding fields to User table and doing the migration.
flask db migrate -m "new fields in user model"
flask db upgrade


****Debug mode:
set FLASK_DEBUG=1


****configure email:  - do in venv, not CMD or Python
(internal mock email)
set MAIL_SERVER=localhost
set MAIL_PORT=8025

set MAIL_SERVER=smtp.googlemail.com
set MAIL_PORT=587
set MAIL_USE_TLS=1
set MAIL_USERNAME=clubmgr2020@gmail.com
set MAIL_PASSWORD=ClubMgr2020!

****Regression test pack:
python tests.py


****Module 13 - translation (only to ES in example, repeat for other languages)

pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k _l -o messages.pot .
pybabel init -i messages.pot -d app/translations -l es
pybabel compile -d app/translations
* to add extra lines with a conversion utility (adding _() or _1() ) then issue
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k _l -o messages.pot .
pybabel update -i messages.pot -d app/translations


****Module 14
